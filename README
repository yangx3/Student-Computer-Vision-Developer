This repo contains codes that ONLY use for TESTING of the project "Student Computer Vision Developer" in OSU.
For OSU student: this repo does not contains ANY assignment/project in ANY OSU course, but as an OSU student, I may
create file/folder names as OSU COURSE NAME to reminder me what kind of tech I need to use. So even you find out any 
COURSE PROJECT TITLE it DOESN'T mean it is a REAL COURSE PROJECT. But I don't mind if you just look at my code.
For non-OSU student: this repo is definitely USELESS to you. Just close it.
For OSU/non-OSU student but in the CS capstone: OK you are in the wrong place, this place contains the treasure but is NOT been
used in capstone, wrong way! But you can take a look and get some idea.
For other: Welcome, stay awhile and listen, that's it.
